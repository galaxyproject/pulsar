Configuring Pulsar
------------------

If either installation procedure has been followed, your Pulsar directory
should contain two files of interest: ``app.yml`` to configure the Pulsar
application and ``server.ini`` to configure the web server (unless you are
running Pulsar without a web server).

Default values are specified for all configuration options that will work if
Pulsar is running on the same host as Galaxy (e.g. for testing and development).
Otherwise, the ``host`` setting of ``server.ini`` will need to be modified to
listen for external requests.

``app.yml`` settings can be overridden by
setting environment variables, just as with Galaxy, by prefixing the config
setting name with ``PULSAR_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_``. For example::

    $ export PULSAR_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_PRIVATE_TOKEN=changed
    $ pulsar

Defaults can also be set via environment variables by prefixing them with
``PULSAR_CONFIG_``. For example, ``PULSAR_CONFIG_PRIVATE_TOKEN``.

Security
--------

Out of the box, **Pulsar essentially allows anyone with network access to the
Pulsar server to execute arbitrary code and read and write any files the web
server can access.** Hence, in most settings steps should be taken to secure the
Pulsar server.

Private Token
`````````````

If running Pulsar with a web server, you *must* specify a private token (a
shared secret between Pulsar and the Galaxy server) to prevent unauthorized
access. This is done by simply setting ``private_token`` in ``app.yml`` to some
long random string.

Once a private token is configured, Galaxy job destinations should include a
``private_token`` parameter to authenticate these jobs.

Pulsar Web Server
`````````````````

The default Pulsar web server, `Paste`_ can be configured to use SSL and to
require the client (i.e. Galaxy) to pass along a private token authorizing
use.

.. tip::

    SSL support is built in to `uWSGI`_, an alternate webserver that can be
    installed (see :ref:`install`).

``pyOpenSSL`` is required to configure a Pulsar web server to server content via
HTTPS/SSL. This dependency can be difficult to install and seems to be getting
more difficult. Under Linux you will want to ensure the needed dependencies to
compile pyOpenSSL are available - for instance in a fresh Ubuntu image you
will likely need::

    $ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev python3-dev libssl-dev

Then pyOpenSSL can be installed with the following command (be sure to source
your virtualenv if setup above)::

    $ pip install pyOpenSSL

Once installed, you will need to set the option ``ssl_pem`` in ``server.ini``.
This parameter should reference an OpenSSL certificate file for use by the
Paste_ server. This parameter can be set to ``*`` to automatically generate such
a certificate. An unsigned certificate for testing purposes can be manually
generated by the following method::

    $ openssl genrsa 1024 > host.key
    $ chmod 400 host.key
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365  \
              -key host.key > host.cert
    $ cat host.cert host.key > host.pem
    $ chmod 400 host.pem

More information can be found in the `paste httpserver documentation
<https://github.com/cdent/paste/blob/master/paste/httpserver.py>`_.

Message Queue
`````````````

If Pulsar is processing requests via a :ref:`message queue
<galaxy_with_rabbitmq_conf>` instead of a web server the underlying security
mechanisms of the message queue should be used to secure communication -
deploying Pulsar with SSL and a ``private_token`` described above are not
applicable.

This can be done via two (not mutually exclusive) methods: client SSL
certificates, or password authentication. In either case, you should configure
your AMQP server with SSL.

If using client certificates, you will likely need to set the appropriate (for
your PKI) combination of ``amqp_connect_ssl_ca_certs``,
``amqp_connect_ssl_keyfile``, ``amqp_connect_ssl_certfile``, and
``amqp_connect_ssl_cert_reqs``, in Pulsar's ``app.yml`` file. See
``app.yml.sample`` for more details.

If using password authentication, this information can be set in the
``message_queue_url`` setting in ``app.yml``, e.g., with SSL::

    message_queue_url: amqps://user:password@mqserver.example.org:5671//

You can consult the `Kombu documentation
<http://kombu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/kombu.connection.html>`__ for
even more information.

User Authentication/Authorization
`````````````

You can configure Pulsar to authenticate user during request processing and check
if this user is allowed to run a job.

Various authentication/authorization plugins can be configured in `app.yml` to
do that and plugin parameters depend on auth type. For example, the following
configuration uses `oidc` plugin for authentication and `userlist` for
authorization::

    user_auth:
      authentication:
        - type: oidc
          oidc_jwks_url: https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxx/discovery/v2.0/keys
          oidc_provider: azure
          oidc_username_in_token: preferred_username
          oidc_username_template: *.
      authorization:
        - type: userlist
          userlist_allowed_users:
            - xxx


see `plugins folder
<https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar/user_auth/methods>`_
for available plugins and their parameters.

Customizing the Pulsar Environment (\*nix only)
-----------------------------------------------

For many deployments, Pulsar's environment will need to be tweaked. For
instance to define a ``DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable for the
``drmaa`` Python module or to define the location to a find a location of
Galaxy (via ``GALAXY_HOME``) if certain Galaxy tools require it or if Galaxy
metadata is being set by the Pulsar.

The file ``local_env.sh`` (created automatically by ``pulsar-config``) will be
source by ``pulsar`` before launching the application and by child process
created by Pulsar that require this configuration.

Job Managers (Queues)
---------------------

By default the Pulsar will maintain its own queue of jobs. While ideal for
simple deployments such as those targeting a single Windows instance, if Pulsar
is going to be used on more sophisticated clusters, it can be configured to
maintain multiple such queues with different properties or to delegate to
external job queues (via DRMAA, qsub/qstat CLI commands, or Condor).

For more information on configured external job managers, see :ref:`job_managers`.

Galaxy Tools
------------

Some Galaxy tool wrappers require a copy of the Galaxy codebase itself to run.
Such tools will not run under Windows, but on \*nix hosts the Pulsar can be
configured to add the required Galaxy code a jobs ``PYTHON_PATH`` by setting
``GALAXY_HOME`` environment variable in the Pulsar's ``local_env.sh`` file
(described above).

Most Galaxy tools require external command-line tools, known as *Galaxy Tool
Dependencies*, to execute correctly. In Galaxy, these are provided by its
`Dependency Resolution`_ system. Pulsar uses this same system, which can be
configured via the ``dependency_resolution`` option in ``app.yml``. See the
example in `app.yml.sample`_ for additional information. In its default
configuration, Pulsar will automatically install Conda but not automatically
install missing tool dependencies. Administrators sending large numbers of tools
to Pulsar most likely want to enable the ``auto_install`` option on the
``conda`` dependency resolver or the ``conda_auto_install`` global option so
that it is not necessary to manually install dependencies for tools sent to
Pulsar. Both options are documented in the `app.yml.sample`_ file.

Message Queue (AMQP)
--------------------

Galaxy and Pulsar can be configured to communicate via a message queue instead
of a Pulsar web server. In this mode, Pulsar and Galaxy will send and receive
job control and status messages via an external message queue server using the
`AMQP`_ protocol. This is sometimes referred to as running Pulsar "webless".

Information on configuring `RabbitMQ`_, one such compatible message queue, can
be found in :ref:`galaxy_with_rabbitmq_conf`.

In addition, when using a message queue, Pulsar will download files from and
upload files to Galaxy instead of the inverse.  Message queue mode may be very
advantageous if Pulsar needs to be deployed behind a firewall or if the Galaxy
server is already set up (via proxy web server) for large file transfers.

A template configuration for using Galaxy with a message queue can be created
by ``pulsar-config``::

    $ pulsar-config --mq

You will also need to ensure that the ` ``kombu`` Python dependency is installed
(``pip install kombu``). Once this is available, simply set the
``message_queue_url`` property in ``app.yml`` to the correct URL of your
configured `AMQP`_ endpoint.

AMQP does not guarantee message receipt. It is possible to have Pulsar (and
Galaxy) require acknowledgement of receipt and resend messages that have not
been acknowledged, using the ``amqp_ack*`` options documented in
`app.yml.sample`_, but beware that enabling this option can give rise to the
`Two Generals Problem`_, especially when Galaxy or the Pulsar server are down
(and thus not draining the message queue).

In the event that the connection to the AMQP server is lost during message
publish, the Pulsar server can retry the connection, governed by the
``amqp_publish*`` options documented in `app.yml.sample`_.

By default, `AMQP heartbeats`_ are enabled at an interval of 580 seconds. This
can be adjusted by setting ``amqp_heartbeat`` or disabled by setting it to
``false`` or ``0``.

Caching (Experimental)
----------------------

Pulsar and its client can be configured to cache job input files. For some
workflows this can result in a significant decrease in data transfer and
greater throughput. On the Pulsar server side - the property
``file_cache_dir`` in ``app.yml`` must be set. See Galaxy's `job_conf.xml
<https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/master/lib/galaxy/config/sample/job_conf.xml.sample_advanced>`_ example file for information on configuring the client.
